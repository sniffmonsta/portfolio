                        Observation 01: People often run out of things
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-20">
                        Thought Process: I checked a couple of forum/chat based platforms that indulge in group outings. I’m an extrovert so
                        I love inviting people over and having parties. All we do is chill at home but having more things to do would be
                        fun.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-20">
                        Conclusion: Knowing what is available around is a great way in engaging.Hence, I added a little idea button that
                        pops up things you can do nearby and the avg. time it takes.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-20">
                        Thought Process: At work people can be completely different. I conducted an excersise within my team memebers that
                        each one would present a personal slide show of their interests and who they are this was a once every week event.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-20">
                        Conclusion: To my surprise such unknown talents I came to know of which, peeked my interest in getting to know the
                        person better.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-20">
                        Thought Process: This is very debatable. Cause I’m personally looking for new interesting people to interact with.
                        But I have tons of office contacts added in my FB friend list that I hardly see/meet. It’d be great to know what
                        they’ve been upto
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-20">
                        Conclusion: Known faces is a feature that I added to the whole adding friends experience. To see how many common
                        events you have with that person.
